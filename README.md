# Financial Data Analysis Automation with Python
Automated workflows for end-to-end financial data analysis using Python.

---

## Overview
This repository provides a collection of **automated processes** designed to streamline financial data analysis.  
It is structured into modular phases, each contained in its own folder.  

The goal is to create a **standardized, repeatable, and efficient pipeline** that transforms raw financial data into actionable insights — covering everything from **data cleaning** to **visualization**.

## Process Descriptions

### Data Cleaning
- Removes or imputes **missing values**.  
- Converts **data types** and formats (e.g. dates, currencies).  
- Detects and removes **duplicates** and **outliers**.  
- Produces a clean dataset ready for EDA and modeling.  

*Output:* `cleaned_data.csv` (or equivalent)

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Automatically generates **summary statistics** (mean, median, variance, etc.).  
- Creates **visual profiles** — histograms, boxplots, correlations, and heatmaps.  
- Identifies **patterns**, **anomalies**, and **data relationships**.  

*Output:* Automated HTML or image reports summarizing dataset characteristics.

---

### Feature Engineering
- Builds new **derived features** (e.g. moving averages, ratios, lags).  
- Performs **feature selection** and **transformations** (normalization, encoding).  
- Creates datasets ready for machine learning or statistical modeling.  

*Output:* `features_dataset.csv` or model-ready DataFrame.

---

### Data Visualization
- Produces **static plots and dashboards** to visualize trends and results.  
- Focuses on **financial insights**: time series, volatility, returns, risk indicators.  
- Enables data-driven storytelling through visuals.  

*Output:* `.png`, `.html`, or `.ipynb` visual summaries.

## How to Use

1. The main dataset is **automatically downloaded** in the `src` folder using **Yahoo Finance**.
2. You can also place **any custom dataset** you want to analyze inside the `data_raw` folder — the cleaning scripts will handle it automatically.  
3. Run scripts sequentially in each folder:
   - `1_Data_Cleaning` → clean and standardize data.  
   - `2_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_(EDA)` → explore and summarize.  
   - `3_Feature_Engineering` → create new features.  
   - `4_Data_Visualization` → visualize results.  
4. Review generated files and outputs.  
5. Customize scripts for your dataset or add new modules.

## Requirements

- Python **3.x**
- Main libraries:
  ```bash
  pandas
  numpy
  matplotlib
  seaborn
  scikit-learn
  yfinance
  ```
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook or Spyder for interactive execution.  
- Dependencies can be listed in `requirements.txt` if available.

## Why Automation?

| Benefit | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Repeatability** | Consistent results across multiple datasets |
| **Efficiency** | Saves time on routine tasks |
| **Scalability** | Easy to extend with new modules |
| **Transparency** | Each step is clearly separated and documented |

---

## Customization

You can easily extend the project by:
- Adding new cleaning or preprocessing rules.  
- Including more EDA visualizations or statistical tests.  
- Developing advanced feature engineering functions (e.g., volatility metrics, rolling stats).  
- Integrating visualization dashboards using **Plotly Dash**, **Streamlit**, or **Power BI**.
